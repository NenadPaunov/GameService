# GameService

GameService is a microservice that handles game-related operations, such as creating new games, retrieving game information, and updating game details. 
The service is built using Java 17/Spring Boot 3 and communicates with other microservices in the system to provide a seamless gaming experience for users.

One of the key features of the GameService is the integration of Swagger, 
which provides a user-friendly interface for exploring and testing the various endpoints offered by the service. 
With Swagger, developers and testers can easily experiment with the API, without having to write any code or use complex tools.
